                        sensitivity in addition to instrument correction

        2015-04-02 based on feedback from Robert Anthony, in addition to nan values other non-numeric values may exist. The write that contains a flot() conversion
                   is placed in a try block so we can catch any non-numeric conversion issue and report it as user-defined NAN

R 0.7.1 2015-03-17 added the "waterLevel" parameter to provide user with more control on how the ObsPy module shrinks values under water-level of max spec amplitude 
                   when removing the instrument response.
