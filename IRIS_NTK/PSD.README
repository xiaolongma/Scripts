  DESCRIPTION:
 
     This bundle contains a series of Python scripts to: 
        - request/read waveforms for given network/station/location/channels using the obspy FDSN client
        - compute and populate an hourly "PSD database"
        - extract PSDs and PDFs from the "PSD database"
 
 
  INSTALLATION:
 
     see INSTALL.txt

  RUNNING THE SCRIPTS:
 
     see the bundle SeisCode Wiki page for instructions and examples:
        https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/projects/noise-toolkit-pdf-psd-bundle/wiki

  NOTES 
 
     - for more information:
         .visit data product's web page at:
            http://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/noise-toolkit-pdf-psd/

     - the "DeprecationWarning: Development and maintenance efforts will focus on the new obspy.fdsn client....." message
       that you receive from the script is caused by script loading the IRIS module, as described below for the infrasound stations, and should not
       affect the run
 
 
  HISTORY
 
     - 2015-04-07 R0.8.0: now produces clear messages for missing parameters in the parameter file. Addresses reported maximum period values. Minor bugs and enhancements
     - 2015-02-24 R0.7.0: introduced two new parameters (performInstrumentCorrection, applyScale) to allow user avoid instrument correction also now user can turn od decon. filter
     - 2014-11-24 R0.6.2: documentation update and expansion of the common.py file to support Microseism Energy bundle
     - 2014-10-16 R0.6.0: ntk_extractPsdHour.py output file name now includes the x-axis type
     - 2014-10-01 R0.5.0: initial Beta release. Made the smoothing configureable, reorganized parameters for easier maintenance
     - 2014-05-20 modified the output format to:
         1. compute hourly PSDs and store them under the psdDb directory (this will be similar to PQLXâ€™s database) as basis for script outputs
         2. provide the extractPsdHourly.py script to extract PSD's for a given channel and bounding parameters. The output is similar to PQLX's exPSDhour script
         3. provide the extractPdf.py that will extract PSDs to create (hourly and daily)  PDFs for a given channel and bounding parameters. 
            The output is similar to the current PDF output from the PDF-PSD data product (http://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/pdf-psd/)
 
            Users should be able to use the above outputs with their existing scripts that work with the PQLX and Quack outputs (hourly bin files have hour-minute
            as the first column to avoid cross-reference to hour.bin file of Quack
 
     - 2014-03-19: Added data file input option
     - 2014-03-07: Initial Alpha release
