%%%%%%%%%%%%

exist function problem
- returns true for any directory/file name on path so we need to test
  for existence only in the current directory (if not absolute)
  - means appending ./ (for linux) on any relative path
- possible workaround: ~exist(dir,7) || isempty(xdir(dir))

matio noise function problem
- noise_process quietly fails if directory has sac files when matio is true
  - need a way to inform the user of this...
  - noise_sac2mat could be used...

4 noise codes handle autoxc
5 noise array phase and attenuation like in prieto 2009
6 test & tutorials
7 fss codes
8 geofss codes (use mmap image option)
9 test & tutorials
10 data grabbing codes
grab_events
grab_stations
grab_channels
grab_responses
grab_seismograms
11 tpw
12 2d inversion on a sphere
13 reflectivity
14 parallel version available using comment tags to allow switching
   % __SEIZMO_PARALLEL__
   % __SEIZMO_SERIAL__
   functions

way to make movies while you do other things on the screen:
## hf = figure(‘visible’, ‘off’)
## addframe(aviobj, hf)

cmt
 - neu 2 enu (is this worthwhile?)
 - plotmt: tpb, nodal line plotting
 - plotmt3: coloring per mt
 - isc database
 - usgs database
 - mt_nodallines

noise
 - HARD: overlap option for stack stuff
 - HARD: better rotate_correlations for processing
 - check horizontals code

fss
 - compute spectra not centered on 0,0?
   - complicates cart2pol & pol2cart
   - input style: [nsmin nsmax nspts],[esmin esmax espts]
                  [bazmin bazmax bazpts],[smin smax spts]
                  smax,[espts nspts]
                  smax,[spts bazpts]
                  espts,nspts,spts default to 101
                  bazpts default to 181
 - amplitudes of unwhitened, tdss & capon
   - 1/(2*pi) factor?
   - power spectral density is scaled by 2*delta/npts (td measures)
 - half+auto => full for xc when desired
   - this should just be a function
 - averaging across frequency (mainly for capon method)
 - test again!
geofss
 - rewrites
   - geo(fssxc,tdssxc)
     - antipodal issue?
 - write
   - geo(fsshorz,fsshorzxc,tdsshorzxc,arfhorz)
     - much of this should come from non-geo versions
 - test!

rotate_correlations
    - not ready
      - need single dataset i/o
      - need horiz autoxc support (3 vs 4 files)

meld
    - uneven or variable samplerate

rotate
    - through option
    - rewrite option code

figure out strange narrow long-period peaks in noise results
    - window length does not affect it.
    - response taper affects it?
    - happens even without response removal?
    - real signal?

more cmb models (rjk)
    - we need to allow parameter setting (while loop rather than for)
        - cell of numbers  {depths/heights  velo%s}
        - inputs will change per model or series ...
        - can never really do everything here ... just go for basics

syncsample
    - 1,2,3,4+ datasets
    - this will be underneath rotate, meld, rotate_correlations, 

new datasets
    - natural earth: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/
    - gplates stuff
    - utig plate boundaries: ftp://ftp.ig.utexas.edu/pub/LIPS/Data/plate_boundaries/
    - seamounts: http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/PT/SMTS/main.html
    - ml & fz: http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/PT/GSFML/
    - seafloor age stuff: http://www.earthbyte.org/Research/Current/agegrid2008.html
    - srtm30plus 7.0

rename to MOSS:
    Matlab & Octave Seismology Scripts
    (Easy, Natural, Mo, PASSCAL & OSS ties!)
add screenshots for newer stuff
	- better 2pw kernels
	- cmts on maps, etc
	- mantle maps & profiles
	- other mapping features
	- power spectra

fix doc formatting
    - examples
    - description
fix checkheader calls (and remove redundant checks)
better versioninfo usage
    - caching should be dropped in all but the lowest level cases
    - seizmocheck should be used instead for the most part

improve top-level help file
    - some intros to basic signal processing tasks, cmts, plotting
    - walk-thrus of analysis codes

checking needs some tolerance (just too strict...)
    - delta/b often differ by a neglegible amount

slantstacking
vespagrams
writegmt
historical quakes
subduction zone contours/sheets

improved plotting
    - moving into the gui department would be nice for plotting only
      some records (like for pages of 20 records), changing axes, etc
    - header info on selection
	- cmp vs cmp (plot 2 components with time)
    - particle motion (color changing line to show time progression? how?)
    - true gui buttons could make this really nice
		- drop down(s) to select component (!!!)
		- phase picking
		- show predicted phase times
		- so much more...

3cmp support
    - how do we indicate 3cmp? iftype?
    - need functions to go from 1-cmp to 3-cmp and back
    - what to do if not all 3 exist?
    - this is great for rotations and particle motions
	- force as ZNE
	- how to handle gaps/overlaps
	- how to handle non-synced breaks in components
	- movies/plots of 3-d particle motion
	- movies/plots of 2-d particle motion

standard instrument responses database
    - this leads into inst resp checking
      ie. this is a STS-2 but the response
          is not as expected...
update polezero db
	- we should keep this external somehow...
		- installation requires running a cmt update
		  & a polezero update -- sounds good to me!
database of station info?
    - mda query functions...
    - rdseed 5.0+ pz output has stn info...
better polezero docs
	- units of poles and zeros
		- sac radians
	- what makes the constant
		- (2*pi)^(np-nz)
		- a0 (normalization constant - at wn the transfer function is 1 with a0)
		- sensor gain (sensitivity - gives appropriate units) 
		- digitizer gain (volts/bit - bit/volts)
	- dis 2 vel
		- add pole at 0
	- vel 2 dis
		- add zero at 0
	- SERIOUSLY FOLKS, why is there not a simple gui for this?

ffmancor
    - dynamic ray tracing is a must (see princeton group)
	- stretch/squish gradually starting at some depth
	- period sets up radial cos
    - define azimuthal cos
	- reflect off cmb
    - can we make this something like 1e-6 s/km^3 ?

sph harm mantle models
    - really need codes to synthesize info at points
ani mantle models

picking
    - better understanding of ppk in SAC
    - mimic it as much as possible
autopicking
    - sta/lta style

glitch & step removal
    - SAC has glitch detection ... implement it?
smooth spline removal (requires spline toolbox)

drop restrictive copyright functions
	buttord2 (edit of buttord)
	ddendrogram (edit of dendrogram)

slidingavg
    - nan support
    - check against other running mean functions

getpeaks
markpeaks
basic segy (segy2MAT), ah, miniseed support

OCTAVE SPECIFIC STUFF
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
- error & warning need sprintf support
- octave-java package issues with Fedora (as root):
    cd /usr/lib/jvm/
    ln -s /etc/alternatives/java_sdk default-java
    cd /usr/lib/jvm/default-java/jre/lib/amd64/
    ln -s server client
- no import function
    - use javaObject & javaMethod
- concatenation differs if cells & empties involved
    - avoid multitype concatenation
- box doesn't take ax (patch applied to devel branch)
- a(b(end)) fails if a not declared (fix applied to stable branch)
- addpath works backwards
- rmpath/unzip etc beat text to the prompt
- unzip on existing unzipped contents will look stalled
    - type y/n/A/N to get through it
- no texlabel
- no axescheck (use personal axparse function)
